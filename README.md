This is a Vue starting point for the Gumnut hackathon.
It's a simple app which lets you edit and update pipes.

You should follow [the guide here](https://docs.gumnut.dev/components/vue.html) to add Gumnut.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. check out this repo `git clone https://github.com/gumnutdev/vue-demo.git`

2. run `pnpm install`

3. run `pnpm start`

This does not yet contain any Gumnut code.

## Notes

This uses shadcn-vue for components.
You can add more components with a command like `pnpm dlx shadcn-vue@latest add button` - [see more here](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/installation/vite.html).
